# GitHub Markdown Menu

> Browser extension that adds a navigation menu to any readme or Markdown file in GitHub.

GitHub readmes and Markdown documents don't always include a table of contents. Well-documented repos have longer documents that can be difficult to navigate. This extension will automagically generate and add navigation menu with a table of contents.

Click on the three-bar icon at the top of any Markdown file to view the menu. Click on a link to scroll to that section of the document. That's it!

## Install

[Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-markdown-menu/jekgocfoijmbgcjejohdgmojaejofdpo)

You can also setup the dev version:

- clone the repo
- open the [extensions page](chrome://extensions)
- enable Developer mode
- click Load unpacked extension, choosing the chrome/app directory

## Supported Browsers

Current:
- Chrome

Planned:
- Firefox
- Safari
- Opera

I have experience developing Chrome extensions, so that was easiest to start with. I plan to add support for Firefox and then Safari and Opera.

## Permissions

In Chrome, you'll be approving the following permissions:
- Read and change your data on github.com
> This extension is scoped and enabled only when accessing https://github.com/\*. This is necessary to look for Markdown headers and add the navigation menu.

- Read your browsing history
> For this extension to work across page navigations within github.com, permissions are necessary to use chrome.webNavigation.onHistoryStateUpdated. This lets the extension hook into page navigations and trigger without full page refreshes. Seems odd this is necessary. If you'd like to help improve the extension to work without this, be my guest!

### More on Permissions

Over the years I've found that certain Chrome APIs required more permissions over time. I've also seen a lot of negative reviews for Chrome extensions wondering why more permissions are being requested. This is understandable; it certainly seems intrusive to ask for more permissions.

I've listed the specific reasons for each permission to explain why they are needed. Between that, and the full source code made available under the [MIT license](http://mit-license.org/), I hope that alleviates any concerns.

## Contribute

Pull requests welcome. :smile:

Post or reply to an [issue](https://github.com/willklein/github-markdown-menu/issues) for whatever you'd like to work on. I'll happily work with you to make your efforts successful!

### Guidelines

- in the chrome directory, run npm install
- run grunt debug to run tests
- setup [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) in your preferred editor to maintain file consistency

### Dependencies

The Chrome extension was generated using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and the [Chrome Extension generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-chrome-extension). [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is used for building and packaging the extension. There are no runtime dependencies.
